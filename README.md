# Monte-Carlo
changing the interaction energies e11, e22, and e12 will affect the calculated chemical potentials, which are plotted as a function of concentration. Specifically, the chemical potential is a measure of the free energy of a species, which depends on the interaction energy between that species and other species in the system.
